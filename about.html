        This is a website I made for practice, I most likely won't be using it
        as my main one but wanted to put my knowledge gained during school to
        use and build something.

      <p>
        I am a web developer living in Apple Valley, Minnesota. I was
        self-taught before I decided to pursue a class based learning approach.
        I started <a href="http://lambdaschool.com">Lambda School</a> back in
        July of last year, I'm scheduled to graduate in August of this year.
        We're in the backend portion now using SQL and Node, already I've
        learned more HTML, CSS, JavaScript than I knew going in, and have
        learned React and a few other technologies that will help me achieve my
        goals.
